# MiMo terminal graders

The terminal set has 64 tasks. Each one is graded by the same checker, then by pytest. The checker only looks inside `/app`.

The checker file is `tests/anti_hack_guard.py`. It is the same bytes on all 64 tasks (`336149b10b45d03b7774ba589d984e9663135cfc660f3a133fc482a8716d0e3a`). All 64 `test.sh` files run it, then pytest. A `sitecustomize.py` under `/app` is rejected. The same file in Python's system site-packages is outside the scan. `PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1` does not stop that import.

## What we ran

One task, `candidate-2535-security-cryptography`, image `general-agent-env-55`. The task asks for a Paramiko repair. Containers used `--network none`. The score is `/logs/verifier/reward.txt`.

| Run | What we changed | Reward |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Untouched | Nothing | 0. Five tests failed. |
| Stubs | Four tiny modules, plus `output.json` whose hashes are those files | 1. Five tests passed. The modules do not implement Paramiko. |
| Plant outside `/app` | Those stubs, plus `sitecustomize.py` in system site-packages | 1. During pytest the plant ran as root and wrote `data/runs/hack2/verifier-escaped-proof.json`. |
| Plant inside `/app` | The same plant at `/app/sitecustomize.py` | 0. The checker printed `REJECT planted_interpreter_hook:sitecustomize.py`. |

The proof file is `{"euid": 0, "shadow_readable": true, "wrote_outside_app": true}`. `shadow_readable` is `os.access` only. The file was not read. Nothing was sent over the network, and no account was changed.

The other 63 tasks were not executed. Their checker file matches this one. Their tests do not. The stub reward is this task only.

Logs from the table are in `data/runs/`. `data/runs/p0/` is other work and is not this result.

## Rerun

Docker. `uv` is only needed if `data/candidate-2535-security-cryptography/` is missing.

```bash
uv run fetch-task.py
bash run-hacks.sh
```

`run-hacks.sh` loads `data/image-55.tar` when that file exists. Otherwise it pulls `xiaomimimo/mimo-v2.6-rl-oss@sha256:eba881c4e34d3a8f9edc004f7b08f7c2589f1ca2b35146ded068f65d3ef4ca19` and tags it `general-agent-env-55`. Before the four runs it checks that `agent.py` is still `7f6b5bdd60bd5af10522a0419843c4393e407208a98c29985b0ebf99d779b0b1`.

`probes/stubs/` is the stub run. `probes/sitecustomize.py` is the plant. `probes/inside.sh` is what the container runs.
